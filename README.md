# Kyle Peeler's dotfiles

[TODO: screenshots]

These are my dotfiles. Use at your own risk, they are what work for me and may update at anytime. 

***Do not blindly install them without reading every line of code.***
If you are planning to use them for yourself, please fork it before cloning and installing. 

These target macOS systems.

## Package Overview

I recently came into possession of a machine that is not _owned_ by me, but is something I will be using almost everyday for development. I created this package to serve as it's source of truth for configuration, such that I can easily transfer these settings to another machine at a moment's notice. Additionally, this will help to keep my sanity, as I can work on both my personal and work machines with settings in sync.

In order to support keeping multiple machines synchronized, the base config file is [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence), meaning it can be sourced multiple times without harm (only pulling the _latest_ configuration).
