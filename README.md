# Kyle Peeler's dotfiles

[TODO: screenshots]

These are my dotfiles. Use at your own risk, they are what work for me and may update at anytime. 

***Do not blindly install them without reading every line of code.***
If you are planning to use them for yourself, please fork it before cloning and installing. 

These target macOS systems.

## Package Overview
I have put a lot of time in configuring my system in a way that works for me, and I want to maintain it's history, and share it with the world.

Additionally, I now have multiple machines, and I want to keep a common configuration of my development enviornment synchronized and version controlled across them. 

In order to accomplish this, the base source file linking the configurations is [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence), meaning it can be sourced multiple times without harm (only pulling the _latest_ configuration).

All files are bootstrapped with [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).
